  Deeply in love with coding, I am a seasoned software engineer known for my self-initiated prowess in back-end development. My drive for software originates from envisioning unique ideas and materializing them with polished interfaces. I hold the user experience, architectural design, and the pristine quality of what I build in high regard.

  Currently, I'm broadening my horizons by self-studying a variety of subjects: from cybersecurity and network security to hardware and support fundamentals (Comptia+), networking, database systems, and beyond. My journey into the tech world is ever-evolving, and I continuously seek to integrate the latest advancements into my skill set.
